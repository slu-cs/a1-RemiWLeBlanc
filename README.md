Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some information is missing.
    - I can't find who works at the BoE and how to email them.
    - I can't find any information on elections taking place in 2020.
    - I can't find any information on early voting.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the registration/absentee deadlines in 2020.    

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The Voting page is lengthy. Would be nice to split it up.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - The blue links are squinty against the dark background.
